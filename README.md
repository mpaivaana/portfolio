# Welcome to My Groovy Vinyl Record Collection!

Hey there, music enthusiasts and retro lovers! Welcome to my groovy little corner of the web! 🎶 This is my personal portfolio, a blast from the past, crafted with ❤️ using React. Here, I'll show off some of my musical coding adventures and mad skills in the world of web development! 🚀

## About Me

Let me spin some tunes about myself – I'm Ana Paiva, a hip back-end developer with a passion for coding and a knack for creating exciting projects. I've dabbled in the realms of C++, Arduino, and AWS, but my true love lies in the wonderful world of web technologies! I'm on a thrilling journey to become a full-stack maestro 🎵, combining the powers of JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, CSS, HTML, Postman, Figma, and MySQL!

## Let's Jam Together!

I'm always up for a groovy collaboration or a jam session with fellow music-loving developers. Feel free to drop a needle and reach out to me via:

- 😺 GitHub: https://github.com/mpaivaana

You can also catch me at the local record store, flipping through dusty vinyl classics. 🎶 But using the above methods is faster and more reliable! 😉

Thanks for tuning in, and I can't wait to make some musical magic with you! Happy coding and keep those records spinning! 🎧🎶
